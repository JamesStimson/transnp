# **transnp**

### Introduction

This is **transnp**, which takes SNP alignments for clusters, together with sampling dates and some assumptions, and models transmission events and times.

There is an introductory vignette in the vignettes folder.

This contains the work of Yuanwei Xu, James Stimson and Caroline Colijn.

### Installation

You can install **transnp** in **R** using the following command:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("JamesStimson/transnp", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Getting help

Alternatively, you can run the R markdown *vignettes/intro.Rmd* yourself.
